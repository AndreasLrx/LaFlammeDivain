<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Before starting the app, we have created a [Game Design Document](https://www.figma.com/file/Ppd6RoeR3Xs6KQeoFx8FqF/La-flamme-Divain?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=gJZTL7G03ZN2wieZ-1) to have a global idea of the app.

This is the end of year Epitech project in the Pre-MSc cursus. In this project, students decides their own project to show the skills they acquired during the year.
